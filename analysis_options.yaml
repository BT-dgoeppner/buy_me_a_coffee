# There are four similar analysis options files in the flutter repos:
#   - analysis_options.yaml
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml (this file)
#   - https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by "flutter analyze" and the
# dartanalyzer when analyzing code outside the flutter repository. It isn't named
# 'analysis_options.yaml' because otherwise editors would use it when analyzing
# the flutter tool itself.
#
# When editing, make sure you keep this and /analysis_options.yaml consistent.
